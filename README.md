## What is Responsive Web Design?
> -    Respond and adjust accordingly to the prevalence of mobile browsing from devices like laptops, tablets, and smartphones. 
> -    Responsive web design is a concept, which when implemented the right way can **improve the UX**.

**Concepts:**

-	Responsive Website Design (RWD): Websites that are built with responsive design use media queries to target `breakpoints` that scale images, wrap text and adjust the layout so that the website can `shrink to fit` any size of the screen.

-	Adaptive Website Design (AWD): Adaptive design typically uses `multiple fixed layout sizes`—when the system detects the browser size, it selects the layout most appropriate for the screen.

-	Fluid Website Design: Websites that are built with fluid design use `percentages for widths`.

-	Fixed Design: Websites that are built using fixed design rely on `fixed pixel widths`. While a design with fixed dimensions can sometimes be the quickest way to get up and running, it’ll provide a less user-friendly across multiple devices.
